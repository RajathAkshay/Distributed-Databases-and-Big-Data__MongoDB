# Distributed-Databases-and-Big-Data__MongoDB
StopFire is a campaign started by Monash University to predict and stop the fire in Victorian cities. They have employed sensors in different cities of Victoria and have collected a large amount of data. The data is so big that their techniques have failed to provide the results on time to predict fire. They have hired us as the data analyst to migrate their data to the NoSQL database (MongoDB). They want us to analyse their data and provide them with results. In addition, they want us to build an application, a complete setup from streaming to storing and analyzing the data for them using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Streaming and MongoDB.

# Information on Dataset
Climate data is recorded on a daily basis whereas Fire data is recorded based on the occurrence of a fire on a particular day. Therefore, for one climate data, there can be zero or many fire data.
The data is NOT row per weather station basis. You can simply think of it as, Station 1 was reporting data for X number of days and then Station 2 started reporting data because Station 1 was shut down for instance.
 
Total precipitation (rain and/or melted snow)â€‹ reported during the day in inches and hundredths; will usually not end with the midnight observation --i.e., may include latter part of the previous day.
.00 indicates no measurable precipitation (includes a trace). Missing = 99.99 (For metric version, units = millimeters to tenths & missing = 999.9.)
Note: Many stations do not report '0' on days with no precipitation --therefore, '99.99' will often appear on these days. Also, for example, a station may only report a 6-hour amount
for the period during which rain fell. See Flag field information below the source of data. A = 1 report of 6-hour precipitation amount.
B = Summation of 2 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount.
C = Summation of 3 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount.
D = Summation of 4 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount. E = 1 report of 12-hour precipitation amount.
F = Summation of 2 reports of 12-hour precipitation amount. G = 1 report of 24-hour precipitation amount.
H = Station reported '0' as the amount for the day (eg, from 6-hour reports), but also reported at least one the occurrence of precipitation in hourly observations --this could indicate a trace occurred but should be considered as incomplete data for the day.
I = Station did not report any precipitation data for the day and did not report any occurrences of precipitation in its hourly observations --it's still possible that precipitation occurred but was not reported.
